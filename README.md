Write a program that takes input of  integers N and M, followed by N more integers and then M more integers.
For each of the last M numbers, the program outputs true, if that number was present in the array of N numbers,
output False otherwise.?

Your output lines should not have any trailing or leading whitespaces
In case of error your output should be 0

## Constraints:
0 < N <= 20,000

0 < M <= 15,000

## Input
4 2
99 12 10 23
23
25

## Output
True
False

## Explanation: 
An input of size 4 is taken, followed by 2 lines.
23 outputs True, since 23 is present in above array, 25 outputs false because it was not in the array of N integers.
